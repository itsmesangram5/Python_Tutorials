# if your program is showing error that variable is not defined 
# you just write
variable=''
# if you are using while loop for true and false purpose 
# always first define that value as true
m=True
while m:
    # will execute this code otherwise not
    pass
#ypu can also use this if you have to just execute whole while loop without any codition 
# for example reffer 9.7.py
